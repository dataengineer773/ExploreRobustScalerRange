The range used to scale each variable is chosen by defult as the IQR is bounded by the 25th and 75th percentile.This is specefic by the quantile_range argument as tupple, Other values can be specefic and
might improve the performance of the model, such as wider range allowing fewer values to be considered outliers, or a more narrow range, allowing more values to be considered outliers. we use to this project
explore the effect of diffrents of the range from 1st to 99th percentile to 30th to 70th percentiles.
